A simple evolutionary simulation in which a population of agents with simple
sensors and small neural networks learn to chase food bits.

For now, the population shares a common network (clonal) and evolution is
basically a simple hillclimber (i.e. a 1+1 ES).

Compile with `javac World.java`, then run with `java World`.
